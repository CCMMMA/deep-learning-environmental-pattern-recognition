**Numerical model output**

The production data is available via OPEnDAP and WMS on http://data.meteo.uniparthenope.it or using a public REST API (http://api.meteo.uniparthenope.it).

**WRF model output**

The dataset available here has been produced manually labeling the WRF model (https://github.com/wrf-model) output produced by the Center for Marine and atmosphere Monitoring and Modelling Applications (CCMMMA, meteo@uniparthenope, http://meteo.uniparthenope.it) run by the University of Naples "Parthenope".

WRF is configured using 3 nested domains characterized by 56 vertical levels: D01 covering the Euro-Mediterranean area (25 km resolution), D02 covering the Italian Peninsula, the Italian big islands, and the surrounding seas (5 Km resolution), and D03 covering the Eastern sector of the Center and Southern Tyrrhenian sea (1 km resolution).
