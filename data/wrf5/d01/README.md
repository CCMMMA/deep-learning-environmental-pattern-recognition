**Labelled WRF model output**

The datast available here has been produced manually labelling the WRF model output produced by the Center for Marine and atmosphere Monitoring and Modelling Applications (CCMMMA, meteo@uniparthenope, http://meteo.uniparthenope.it) run by the University of Naples "Parthenope".

The weather patterns have been labelled mainly by Gaetano Genovese advised by Vincenzo Capozzi during the research work finalised to obtain his MSC using the Weather Lebelling Web Application (WLWA, https://github.com/CCMMMA/Weather-Labeling-Web-Application).

WLWA has been designed by Raffaele Montella (https://github.com/raffmont) and implemented by Rosario Riccio (https://github.com/rosario-riccio) as his Computer Science BSC final work thesis.
